# Mock Data Directory

This directory contains all mock data files used for testing and development purposes.

## Purpose
- Store sample data for testing various components
- Provide mock responses for API endpoints
- Include test documents and sample inputs
- Organize development and testing data separately from production code

## Structure
- `documents/` - Sample documents for testing document processing
- `responses/` - Mock API responses
- `inputs/` - Sample input data for testing
- `configs/` - Mock configuration files

## Usage
When adding new mock data:
1. Place files in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Add documentation if the mock data has specific requirements
4. Keep mock data lightweight and focused on testing scenarios
